{"name":"Jakstab","tagline":"The Jakstab static analysis platform for binaries","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nJakstab is an Abstract Interpretation-based, integrated disassembly and static analysis framework for designing analyses on executables and recovering reliable control flow graphs. It is designed to be adaptable to multiple hardware platforms using customized instruction decoding and processor specifications. It is written in Java, and in its current state supports x86 processors and 32-bit Windows PE or Linux ELF executables.\r\n\r\nJakstab translates machine code to a low level intermediate language on the fly as it performs data flow analysis on the growing control flow graph. Data flow information is used to resolve branch targets and discover new code locations. Other analyses can either be implemented in Jakstab to run together with the main control flow reconstruction to improve precision of the disassembly, or they can work on the resulting preprocessed control flow graph.\r\n\r\nThe most detailed description of the entire system so far is contained in Johannes Kinder's dissertation:\r\n\r\n* Johannes Kinder: Static Analysis of x86 Executables. Technische Universität Darmstadt, 2010. [PDF](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:tuda-tuprints-23388)\r\n\r\n### Running Jakstab\r\n\r\nJakstab is invoked via the command line, it comes with both a Windows and a Unix shell script for setting the correct classpath. The package contains a set of examples for unit testing, you can try it out on those by running\r\n```\r\njakstab -m input/helloworld.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor a default Bounded Address Tracking run on the helloworld executable, or by running\r\n```\r\njakstab -m input/jumptable.exe --cpa xfi\r\n```\r\nfor analyzing a jumptable example with Bounded Address Tracking, forward expression substitution, and interval analysis. It is still a research prototype, so all interfaces are likely to change with new versions without further notice.\r\n\r\n### Outputs\r\n\r\nAfter finishing analysis, Jakstab creates the following files:\r\n* `filename_jak.asm` - A disassembly with all reachable instructions\r\n* `filename_cfa.dot` - A CFG in the intermediate language, instruction by instruction\r\n* `filename_asmcfg.dot` - A CFG of assembly instructions, in basic blocks\r\n\r\n### Supported Analyses\r\n\r\nThe analyses (CPAs) that should be working correctly are:\r\n* Bounded Address Tracking (x) (see FMCAD'10)\r\n* VPC-lifted Bounded Address Tracking (v) (see WCRE'12)\r\n* Constant Propagation (c)\r\n* Forward Expression Substitution (f)\r\n* Interval Analysis (i)\r\n* K-Set Analysis (k)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nThe following publications, sorted chronologically, describe specific aspects of Jakstab, or applications and extensions of it.\r\n\r\nThe CAV 2008 tool paper describes an early implementation of Jakstab, which was based on iterative constant propagation and branch resolution:\r\n\r\n* Johannes Kinder, Helmut Veith. Jakstab: A Static Analysis Platform for Binaries. In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2008), vol. 5123, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer, July 2008, pp. 423–427.\r\n \r\nOur VMCAI 2009 paper introduces a generic framework for disassembly and control flow reconstruction guided by data flow analysis and defines the theoretical background for Jakstab. The framework is not fixed in its choice of domain, but allows to combine control flow reconstruction with any data flow analysis that provides abstract evaluation of expressions:\r\n\r\n* Johannes Kinder, Helmut Veith, Florian Zuleger.

Precise Static Analysis of Untrusted Driver Binaries. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD 2010), October 2010, pp. 43–50.\r\n \r\nIn our paper at VMCAI 2012, we give a reformulation of control flow reconstruction using parameterized semantics, and show how it can be extended to accomodate under-approximations derived from concrete execution traces. A prototype implementation shows that under-approximations allow to reconstruct useful CFGs when the over-approximation would have to conservatively over-approximate indirect jump targets.\r\n\r\n* Johannes Kinder, Dmitry Kravchenko.
